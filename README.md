# Cristian E. Nuno

Hi there ğŸ‘‹ My name is Cristian and I'm a software engineer and I love teaching others how to answer the questions that matter to them using public data. Here is a bit more about me:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a data engineer
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about math and Java
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning how to optimize JavaScript code 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about why I think everyone should create and store their own `.log` files
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love using `git`! The best presentation about learning `git` on a conceptual level can be [found here](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans) (courtesy of Alice Bartlett).
