# Cristian E. Nuno

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Cristian and I'm a software engineer and I love teaching others how to answer the questions that matter to them using public data. Here is a bit more about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on helping a school system automate a lot of manual processes to ensure data across their systems is always up to date
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about math and statistics
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning how to optimize `R` code
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I think everyone should create and store their own `.log` files
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [https://twitter.com/cenuno_](https://twitter.com/cenuno_)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love using `git`! The best presentation about learning `git` on a conceptual level can be [found here](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans) (courtesy of Alice Bartlett).
